# Meme Generator :D

Create simple memes on this web app built using ReactJS :D. I've used this mini project as a starting point to practice ReactJS and deploy React apps on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

[This](https://medium.com/jeremy-gottfrieds-tech-blog/tutorial-how-to-deploy-a-production-react-app-to-heroku-c4831dfcfa08) is an awesome Medium article with easy to follow steps to start deploying your apps on Heroku.

## What's in the repo

* :open_file_folder: *`./build`* - This folder contains all the files that are generated when you build your project using `yarn build` or `npm run build`.
* :open_file_folder: *`./public`* - This folder contains the page template *`index.html`*.
* :open_file_folder: *`./src`* - This folder mostly contains other resources like Javascript files, images, etc. *`index.js`* is the javascript entry point.
* :page_facing_up: *`./package.json`* - This file holds various metadata relevant to the project.
* :page_facing_up: *`./server.js`* - This file has to be created by the user himself which will be used by Heroku to start the server.
* :page_facing_up: *`./yarn.lock`* - This file is created by `yarn install` command and contains meta data about the dependencies used by the project. This can also be *`package-lock.json`* if you use *npm* commands instead of *yarn* commands.

To know more about the folder structure you can also see the [official documentation page](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure).
